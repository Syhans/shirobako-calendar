Kinoshita meets Nogame, the author of Third Aerial Girls Squad. They agree on a new ending for the anime.

Another scenario meeting. Maitake asks Midori to write the script for him. He says he will fix everything by morning. Watanabe says that if they are able to get the added part done by [Thursday](/calendar/2015-12-03) - which Kinoshita promptly confirms - he would like to do re-editing on [Saturday](/calendar/2015-12-05). Katsuragi says that in that case, the after-recording will be on [Sunday](/calendar/2015-12-06).
