Midori finds Aoi researching fighter jets in the library and offers to do the research for her.

Meanwhile, Shizuka receives a script for the Third Aerial Girls Squad audition. It takes place on [February 9](/calendar/2015-02-09).

The date is shown on Aoi's desk phone for a split second as she hangs up after her call with Watanabe. It also displays 9:13 (probably PM, it is dark outside) as the current time. Aoi is still wearing the same outfit that she was wearing at the library.
