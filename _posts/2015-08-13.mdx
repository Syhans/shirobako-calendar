This date assumes that the schedule for the after-recording for episode 1 of Third Aerial Girls Squad has not been pushed back. It is based on Katsuragi's and Nakata's statements back on [February 12](/calendar/2015-02-12), stating that the recording sessions take place on Thursdays, and the production schedule shown on [February 26](/calendar/2015-02-26).

The session is scheduled to begin at 16:00. It ends at 20:05. Aria's VA Suzuki stays longer because she's having trouble getting her lines to sound right.

After the recording, Aoi meets Ookura regarding one of the backgrounds for Third Aerial Girls Squad. After getting a questionable OK from him, Aoi says that she'll come with the art director (Atsumi) tomorrow at 17:00.
