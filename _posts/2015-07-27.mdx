Everything from Aoi, Tarou, Satou and Andou reading the Third Aerial Girls Squad announcement to Aoi, Ema and Midori walking home together.

Aoi points at this date when they discuss the schedule for the PV. She says that Manga Festival is in two weeks (August 13, checks out). Watanabe also says that the PV needs to be delivered by August 9, so they actually only have thirteen days. August 9 minus thirteen days results in the July 27, too.

As the girls walk home, Aoi suggests that they should meet up on Sunday. Midori texts Misa and Shizuka about this.
