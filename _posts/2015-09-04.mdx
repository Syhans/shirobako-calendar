Another scenario meeting. Seems like the scenario has only been outlined so far, as Maitake asks if he can start writing the scenario. So the two weeks mentioned in the previous meeting have probably not yet passed.

Hiraoka and Madoka get into a fight and the situation gets diffused by Okitsu. Marukawa has a talk with Hiraoka. Hiraoka returns to the office shortly after and apologizes to Madoka.

Kunogi overhears Hiraoka ranting about how viewers will be happy if the art is fine above the neck. She visits Ema, who probably took a day off to recover from her cold and asks her about her opinion on this.
