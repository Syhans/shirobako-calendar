Aoi asks Ema to work on the episode as an assistant AD, then visits Segawa to convince her to keep working with Hiraoka, something she promised Hiraoka [about a few days ago](/calendar/2015-10-09).

Aoi receives a call from Misa later, at 21:18.

Doumoto and Shinkawa, as well as Tarou and Hiraoka go out, with the latter opening up about his past and the two getting very drunk in the process. Shizuka watches a special on newbie VAs, featuring a girl who was present at one of her auditions [nearly a year ago](/calendar/2014-10-25). Misa visits the Musashino Animation office.
