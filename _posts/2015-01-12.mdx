Ema, Ogasawara and Iguchi discuss Iguchi's character designs. The guess is based on Watanabe asking Aoi to get sketches from Iguchi ASAP in their call earlier.

Watanabe, Kinoshita, Maitake and Katsuragi visit the Yotaka bookshop main office in the afternoon to discuss the anime adaptation of Third Aerial Girls Squad. The meeting starts (seemingly delayed) at 15:30, and Chazawa leaves again fairly quickly, claiming he has another meetings at 16:00.
