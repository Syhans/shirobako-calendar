Yano stops Iketani from running away multiple times throughout this day.

Aoi, Midori, Kinoshita, Maitake and Katsuragi hold a meeting regarding the scenario for the final episode of Third Aerial Girls Squad. Aoi says that the scenario should be finalized by mid-September, to which Maitake responds that that's never going to happen because there would only be two weeks left.

Note that Ema is sick.

Aoi and Midori see Maitake off and the two girls have a quick chat in the kitchen, afterward, followed by a collection of scenes of MusAni discussing why they work in anime.

Hiraoka and Midori almost run into each other and Hiraoka simply makes a rude remark, which Midori thinks about on the metro on her way home.
