Aoi talks about their plan for now with the other PAs (sans Hiraoka). She and Tarou also have a short conversation about the situations they were in for Exodus' episodes 3 and 8. Aoi and Kinoshita then hold meetings with the CGI staff, the art director, the filming staff and the coloring staff.

Meanwhile, Iguchi is still struggling with the character designs.
