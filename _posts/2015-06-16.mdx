While the rain here is probably moreso intended to set a grim tone, it could be a hint we are now in Japan's rainy season, which starts early summer.

Katsuragi informs Watanabe that all character designs have been rejected. Watanabe then tells Aoi to stop all production.

For reference, the first character designs finished [back in January](/calendar/2015-01-16).

Iguchi is informed that the author of Third Aerial Girls Squad Nogame has requested retakes for the character designs. Aoi asks the other PAs to halt production and gets into an argument with Hiraoka because of it. Aoi also explains the situations to the key animators. Meanwhile, Midori talks about Jiggly Jiggly Heaven with the director.
