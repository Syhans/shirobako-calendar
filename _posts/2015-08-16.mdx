Yano claims to have gone home overnight and she has changed her outfit. This is the day where she officially returns to work after [almost eight months](/calendar/2014-12-11) of absense.

Yano finding a new ED, Aoi visiting the old Musashino Studios building with the Marukawa, Ema forcing Aoi and Midori to eat sour plums and the meeting regarding episode 5 all take place on this day.
