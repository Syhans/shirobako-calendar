Iguchi apologizes that it has been over ten days now.

This is second of three statements in this episode about the current general timeframe. Because of the [third statement](/calendar/2015-07-13), this makes more sense if she means this as ten days since the [last meeting](/calendar/2015-06-26) and not ten days for this situation as a whole.

Iguchi walks into Ema doing the angel exercise and Ogasawara holds a meeting with Aoi, Watanabe and Kinoshita. Aoi, Ema, Ogasawara and Iguchi then head out to play softball to distract Iguchi for a bit. They visit a caf√© after and Ogasawara explains to the others why she is always wearing the outfits she is wearing. They return to the office and have another meeting regarding the character designs.
