Katsuragi and the sound producer Nakata combined reveal some information that is not relevant until [six months later](/calendar/2015-08-13): Nakata mentions that Itou is available on Thursdays, to which Katsuragi adds that fall's schedule favors Itou. She ends up getting picked for the role. So the recording sessions for Third Aerial Girls Squad take place on Thursdays.

    The VA mentioned here, Suzuka Itou, is a reference to real life VA [Shizuka
    Itou](https://myanimelist.net/people/93/Shizuka_Itou), who voices not only
    basically herself in this anime, but also (among others) the aforemontioned
    Nakata. So she's - in a way - reading out her own schedule. Funny story...
