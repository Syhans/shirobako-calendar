Aoi attempts to call Studio Taitanic but does not reach them. It is 3 in the afternoon when she makes the attempt. A calendar in the background at Taitanic Studio reads August.

Ema works on a cut where Aria is eating sour grapes.

Aoi attempts to call Taitanic Studios again later and gets through this time. She asks for the stalled cuts to be delivered tomorrow.

Aoi and Atsumi then visit Ookura.
