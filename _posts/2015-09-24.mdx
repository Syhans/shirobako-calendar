Yano once again stops Iketani from running away several times.

While talking to Watanabe, Aoi says that she will ask Kinoshita to try to get the storyboards done in the four weeks left before the end of the month (referring to October), which implies that the current date lies in late-September.

Watanabe responds to this that even if that gets done in time, they will only have about six weeks until delivery.

Watanabe makes this statement with the assumption that episodes are still delivered two weeks in advance at this point.
