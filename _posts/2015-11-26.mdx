Ema receiving a call from her mother could have happened on any day between October 17 and this day, but there are no further hints that the following events happen on another day.

The day of the after recording of episode 13. Assuming the schedule from [February 26](/calendar/2015-02-26) still holds, this is the Thursday of the week starting November 23.

Katsuragi receives a call from Chazawa that the storyboards for the final episode have been rejected. His phone displays 22:41 when he reveices the call.

He relays the information to Watanabe and Mizuyama and panics, asking if they can really air in five weeks. Episode 13 is scheduled to air on December 31, which checks out perfectly.
