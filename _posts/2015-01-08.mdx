Again, no extra hints to the current time. Aoi and Kinoshita meet Atsumi and offer him the art director position. He requests some time to think about it. On their way back to the office, Aoi mentions that she is going to contact Atsumi "next week", but a lot more time actually passes until they meet him again ([February 11](/calendar/2015-02-10)).
