Given Taitanic's soddy work ethic, Aoi getting her wish of the cuts being delivered "tomorrow" fulfilled is a fair assumption. Their episode director probably OK'd all the cuts without checking them.

The "finished" cuts from Taitanic arrive at MusAni and Kinoshita has Aoi ask for the episode director because the work is incomplete. They even order him into the MusAni offices.

Later, Aoi calls Ookura Workshop and gets told that he has left for two weeks. Ookura did not leave a message, but he left to find some abandoned buildings in the countryside as reference for his backgrounds, as episode 17's post-credit scene shows.

During another call with Taitanic, Aoi is then told that the episode director from earlier has quit the project altogether. Her peers also report some trouble to her.

She starts panicking and is about to freak out completely when Yano arrives back at the office, who then tells her to go home for the night.
