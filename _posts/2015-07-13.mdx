Aoi, Ogasawara, Iguchi, Watanabe, Kinoshita and Katsuragi once again review Iguchi's new designs. Watanabe then calls Chazawa and figures out that he is playing golf, so he and Katsuragi head to the golf range.

Katsuragi yells at Chazawa that "keyframes have been stalled for a month now". He might be exaggerating a little, given the circumstances.

This is third of three statements in this episode about the current general timeframe.

Aoi receives the ok from Nogame on the same day and relays that message to Iguchi.
