This day marks the start of the second half of the show. Unfortunately, compared to the first half, the same screen time is going to be spread over four times the in-universe time, so assigning dates with 100% certainty quite often is not possible anymore, including this on-screen day. This could in theory be any day between January 1 and 8.

Fortunately in this case, [January 9](/calendar/2015-01-09), a Friday, is a confirmed date and is three on-screen days away.

The only hints given towards the time are Watanabe stating that he plans to bring in someone with experience [in February](/calendar/2015-02-11) and two new recruits in spring, [probably April](/calendar/2015-04-06).

The estimated air date of Third Aerial Girls Squad is October 1, a Thrusday.

The actual air date of the first episode is a week later, [October 8](/calendar/2015-10-08).
