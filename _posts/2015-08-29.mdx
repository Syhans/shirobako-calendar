Anything in the montage that shows Ookura on the train, Iketani and Yano at work, Ema receiving her checked key frames from Iguchi and Mii at work could have happened at some other point, too.

The date is based on the call with Ookura Workshop [two weeks ago](/calendar/2015-08-15), where it was stated that Ookura has left for, well, two weeks. Aoi visits Ookura Workshop for the background art. The calendar in the workshop displays August.
