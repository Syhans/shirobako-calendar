The date is based on Tarou gloating about how episode 1 went on air without a hitch, so this is probably the day after the episode aired.

Aoi receives a call from Segawa. Her phone displays 12:43 as the current time.

Segawa requests for Aoi to remove Hiraoka from the episode she is working on. Aoi confronts Hiraoka about this. After he leaves, Aoi asks Yano and Isokawa about how Hiraoka was in trade school.

Meanwhile, Misa is working on her Third Aerial Girls Squad scene.
