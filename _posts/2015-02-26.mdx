Aoi and Kinoshita receive some more character designs from Iguchi.

The scene where Watanabe calls Chazawa is probably a flashback.

Aoi and Watanabe also their schedule for the production of Third Aerial Girls Squad. Two episodes need to be outsourced, so Hiraoka introduces Aoi to Studio Taitanic.
