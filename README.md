An interactive calendar for the chronology of the TV anime series Shirobako.

## FAQ

### How can I contribute? I don't know all this Github stuff.

If you notice anything that needs fixing and are not familiar with the Github workflow, either [send me a message on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mistaarr) or [open up an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/Syhans/shirobako-calendar/issues/new). I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.

### Isn't a Next.js App for a static site with fairly little interactivity like this overkill?

Probably. Something like Astro would be more fitting for a static website like this and I plan on rebuilding this website with Astro sometime over the next few months.

Next.js is just what I know and I can probably make most things work with it, even if it is not the perfect tool for the job.

### The calendar detail pages look a lot like Nextra. Why not just use that?

In hindsight, I probably should have. It did not look like it would be fitting when I was starting out, but I ended up designing the navigation after Nextra's and opted into using MDX components at some point, too.
